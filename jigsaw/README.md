Inkscape instructions to make puzzle pieces:
	In inkscape, open jigsaw.svg and remove the bounding box so that only the horizontal and vertical lines remain.
	Next, combine those paths with "combine", don't worry if it looks like crap.
	Then, import the PNG and place it on the bottom layer, then convert it to a pattern.
	Finally, select all (should be 2 items), and select path -> division. Then save as SVG


Challenge text:
	The grinch has obtained some intelligence that Santa hides a secret message on the
    backside of a jigsaw puzzle that he completed. One of the Grinch's helpers stole the
	puzzle but then dropped it, shuffling all the pieces. Can you complete the jigsaw
	puzzle and retrieve the secret message?
